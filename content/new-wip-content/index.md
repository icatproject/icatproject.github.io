title: Welcome to the ICAT Project
---

The ICAT software takes data from large scientific facilities - such as particle accelerators - and catalogues and indexes it so scientists can find the data they need and share it with their team.

ICAT is in use at some of the world's largest scientific facilities enabling access to millions of scientific results. The software is free & open-source and has been developed & maintained by an international collaboration for over 10 years.
