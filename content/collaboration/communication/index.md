title: Communication
---

Communication within the collaboration is by means of three googlegroup
mailing lists, monthly telephone meetings and a face-to-face meeting
about once a year.

## Mailing lists

None of these groups include other groups. They are:

[icatgroup](http://groups.google.com/group/icatgroup) to which those
interested in ICAT should subscribe. It is used to announce new
releases, for meeting information and for general discussion on ICAT
components.

[icatproject-support](http://groups.google.com/group/icatproject-support) is
for people to post to when seeking support. Anybody can post from within
the project or outside. By subscribing to the list it is expected that
you will attempt to answer support questions. Don't subscribe to ask
questions but to answer them!

## Monthly Meetings

These are normally held on the fourth Thursday of the month at 15:00 UK
time.  See [joining instructions and past meetings](/collaboration/communication/monthly-meetings/ "Monthly Meetings")
and the meetings for
[2016](/collaboration/communication/monthly-meetings/2016-meetings/).

## Face-to-face meetings

See the [face-to-face meetings](/collaboration/communication/face-to-face-meetings) page for a list of all the face-to-face meetings.
