title: The ICAT Project
---

The ICAT project provides a metadata catalogue and related components to
support experimental data management for large-scale facilities, linking all aspects of the
research lifecycle from proposal through to data and articles publication. ICAT includes a
number of [components](/about/components-of-the-icat-project), the principal ones being:

- **ICAT**: the metadata catalogue itself, which provides SOAP and RESTful
  web service interfaces to an underlying database via an easy to use
  API. It has powerful search features, a rule based authorization
  mechanism and it uses plugins for authentication.
- **IDS**: the ICAT Data Service which provides a uniform interface to
  data catalogued by ICAT. It can be used to upload and download
  data and supports a wide range of back-end storage strategies via a
  plugin mechanism.
- **TopCAT**: a web based GUI able to search across multiple ICAT
  instances and download data via the IDS.
- **IJP**: the ICAT Job Portal to allow submission of jobs  to HPC
  resources or compute farms where data selection is based on ICAT
  information and the jobs make use of the IDS for data access.
