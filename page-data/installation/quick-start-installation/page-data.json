Each of these installers has a number. Version 3\ncorresponds to the latest set of Glassfish components.</p>\n<p>Currently you can install the authenticators of your choice, ICAT, and\nthen optionally IDS and TopCAT. In addition you can install some example\nmetadata into ICAT and upload three files so that TopCAT has some data\nto browse and download.</p>\n<p>To make it even easier a couple of option files are provided:\n<a href=\"/misc/installer/options\">options</a> which gives you everything but with\nonly one authenticator (anon -- to give anonymous access) and\n<a href=\"/misc/installer/fulloptions\">fulloptions</a> which gives everything --\nhowever you should still login as anon to be able to see the data in\nTopCAT. In both cases you should edit the first line to give the root\npassword for an installed mysql server. <em>Note that some newer\nmysql/MariaDB installations allow the unix root user to log in as mysql\nroot without providing  a password. This can be avoided by setting the\nplugin field to null in the user table of the mysql database.</em></p>\n<p>You can then enter for linux:</p>\n<pre><code>./icat-3.0-linux-x64-installer.run --optionfile fulloptions\n</code></pre>\n<p>When the window appears just keep clicking on <em>\"forward\"</em> as the values\nhave been filled for you. This will give you a very insecure\ninstallation as no login is required but it will allow you to get\nstarted.</p>\n<p>There is currently a bug with unattended mode of installation -- please\ndon't use the <em>\"--mode\"</em> option.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/installation/installersby_tiny.png\" alt=\"bitrock\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Quick Start Installation","date":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/installation/quick-start-installation/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2186722355","3212510956","3248290905","3649515864","4121107168"],"slicesMap":{}}
