Both sets of instructions should be read before continuing.\nIt is recommended to create an install directory and unzip each ICAT\ncomponent there. Each component will be unzipped into its own directory.\nThe install directory should be kept to facilitate upgrades.</p>\n<p>The component specific instructions will list a set of prerequisites.\nEnsure that these are satisfied before continuing further.</p>\n<h1>The setup script</h1>\n<p>The installation command is setup. Some linux distributions have a setup\ncommand so either place the current directory at the start of your PATH\nor invoke the command as ./setup. The setup command will only work in\nthe unpacked distribution directory.</p>\n<p>Some components make use of config files. These generally take the form\nxxx-setup.properties and xxx.properties. If any configuration file is\nnot present in the current directory when you run any setup command it\nwill be copied from a file of the same name with a .example suffix, you\nwill be invited to edit it, and the command will terminate.</p>\n<p>The setup command has a help flag. So you can enter:</p>\n<pre><code>./setup -h\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will list the options one of which will be -v (or --verbose).\nGenerally -v prints the commands that are being issued and -vv prints\nthe command output as well.</p>\n<h2>Install</h2>\n<p>Change directory to the unpacked distribution and enter</p>\n<pre><code>./setup install\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will now out the installation. It will stop on some errors but will\ngenerally try to continue so that as many problems as possible will be\nfound in each pass.</p>\n<p>There is no need to uninstall before trying to install again.</p>\n<p>It is fine to run install after a successful installation; the component\nwill simply be reinstalled.</p>\n<h2>Uninstall</h2>\n<p>Change directory to the unpacked distribution and enter</p>\n<pre><code>./setup uninstall\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will uninstall the component. Any configuration files will be\nremoved. So if you simply want to install a new version of the component\nthen do not use uninstall on the old one as old configuration files will\nbe lost.</p>\n<h1>Installing a new version of a component.</h1>\n<p>Unzip the new distribution into the install directory and allow the\nunzip command to overwrite any existing files. Delete any old .war or\n.jar files as the install script will otherwise complain that it does\nnot know which one to install and run:</p>\n<pre><code>./setup install\n</code></pre>\n<p>as before. Any old configuration files will be used. ThoughÂ they may\nneed to be updated first if specified in the installation instructions\nand release notes for that component.</p>\n<h1>Installation on Windows</h1>\n<p>The setup scripts will also work on Windows (where it has been tested on\nWindows 7 with Glassfish and MySQL). However please note:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create directories C:\\usr\\bin and C:\\usr\\share</li>\n<li>The Glassfish installer should be avoided -- simply unzip the .zip\nfile. It is recommended to unzip into C:\\ -- do avoid a path with\nspaces for the moment.</li>\n<li>It is easier but not essential to include the Python directory\n(probably C:\\Python27) in your PATH.</li>\n<li>To install suds find a distribution (0.4 is the current one) unpack\nand move the suds directory to the site-packages directory (probably\nC:\\Python27\\Lib\\site-packages)</li>\n<li>Invoke python scripts (such as setup, testicat and asadmin by\npreceding them with python. So instead of <code>./setup install</code> type\n<code>python setup install</code></li>\n<li>testicat and asadmin are by default installed under C:\\usr\\bin</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"ICAT Component","date":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/installation/component/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2186722355","3212510956","3248290905","3649515864","4121107168"],"slicesMap":{}}
