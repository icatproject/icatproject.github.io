The central server's configuration includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>URLs of an ICAT and an IDS instance</li>\n<li>URLs of the batch servers to which it will submit jobs</li>\n<li>Definitions of the job types that it supports</li>\n<li>Default search filters for datasets and datafiles</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A job type defines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a name for the job</li>\n<li>an executable to run on the batch system(s)</li>\n<li>whether job instances accept datasets, datafiles or both</li>\n<li>whether a single job can be run for multiple datasets / datafiles</li>\n<li>further (command-line) options to be passed to the job instance(s)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When the user submits a job, the IJP requests an estimate from each\nattached batch server, and selects one from those that return the best\nestimate.</p>\n<p>Datasets and datafiles are passed to the executable by ID; the\nexecutable must use the ICAT and IDS instances to retrieve the metadata\nor contents. (The connection URLs and the session ID are also passed by\nthe IJP.)</p>\n<p>The unixbatch batch server uses the unix batch system. It can be used to\ntest an IJP server installation (for example, it could be installed on\nthe same machine).</p>\n<p>There is a separate distribution, ijp.demojobs, of sample job types and\nscripts. The job types should be installed in the IJP server, and the\nscripts on the batch server(s). The scripts (mainly written in Python)\ninclude basic connectivity test scripts (e.g. report what was sent from\nthe IJP server) as well as scripts to perform simple IDS tasks such as\nto create a new datafile, or to copyÂ  a datafile to another dataset. The\nscripts demonstrate how to check and extract the arguments supplied by\nthe IJP, and how to use ICAT and IDS to resolve the supplied dataset and\ndatafile IDs.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The ICAT Job Portal","date":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/user-documentation/the-icat-job-portal/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2186722355","3212510956","3248290905","3649515864","4121107168"],"slicesMap":{}}
