This could\nbe many small files or one very large file. It is specifically to cover\nthe case when the web service interface of the IDS to get the data\ndirectly is not convenient because the total volume of data is too\nlarge.</p>\n<h1>Architecture</h1>\n<p>A \"personal server\" runs on your machine. You issue requests to it from\na command line or GUI or from TopCAT. Files are downloaded individually\nfrom an IDS and stored in a location within your home directory. The\nlocation relative to to you home directory is <em>smartclient/&#x3C;dns name of IDS>/&#x3C;icat.location></em>.\nwhere icat.location is the value of the\nDatafile.location held in icat. It is planned to make this configurable.\nIt is possible that two IDS instances may have files with the same value\nof icat.location which is why the dns name of the IDS appears in the\nfile path. The server is distributed with a GUI and, except for Windows,\na CLI. Invoking the GUI or the CLI will cause the server to start up if\nit is not already running.</p>\n<p>When you come to download your basket in TopCAT you will be offered the\npossibility to download using the smartclient</p>\n<p>Both the GUI (which is currently not a thing of beauty though there are\nplans to make it look nice) and the CLI allow you to see how many\ntransfers are queued. Stopping the GUI does not, by design, stop the\nserver component.</p>\n<h1>Installation</h1>\n<p>It is distributed as a .deb for Debian based systems, as an RPM for\nRedHat based, as a .exe for Windows and as a .dmg for the Mac.\nSee <a href=\"https://icatproject.org/misc/smartclient/\">available installation packages</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"IDS Smart Client","date":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/user-documentation/ids-smartclient/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2186722355","3212510956","3248290905","3649515864","4121107168"],"slicesMap":{}}
