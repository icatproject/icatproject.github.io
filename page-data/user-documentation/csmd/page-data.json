It captures high level information about\nscientific studies and the data that they produce.  The ICAT schema\nfinds its origins in CSMD.</p>\n<p>The CSMD is developed to support data collected within a facility's\nscientific workflow. However the model is also designed to be generic\nacross scientific disciplines and has application beyond facilities\nscience, particularly in the \"structural sciences\" (such as chemistry,\nmaterial science, earth science, and biochemistry) which are concerned\nwith analysing the structure of substances, and perform systematic\nexperimental analyses on samples of those materials.</p>\n<p>The model is organised around a notion of Studies, a study being a body\nof scientific work on a particular subject of investigation. During a\nstudy, a scientist would perform a number of investigations e.g.\nexperiments, observations, measurements and simulations. Results from\nthese investigations usually run through different stages: raw data,\nanalysed or derived data and end results suitable for publication. The\nmodel has a hierarchical model of the structure of scientific research\nprogrammes, projects and studies, and also a generic model of the\norganisation of data sets into collections and files.</p>\n<p>For more detail on the CSMD see the <a href=\"http://icatproject-contrib.github.io/CSMD/\" title=\"CSMD Information Page\">CSMD Information Page</a></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://purl.org/net/epubs/manifestation/485\">reference for CSMD 2.0</a> is available.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Core Scientific Metadata Model (CSMD)","date":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/user-documentation/csmd/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2186722355","3212510956","3248290905","3649515864","4121107168"],"slicesMap":{}}
