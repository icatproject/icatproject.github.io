OCTOPUS rallies expertise,\ntechniques and infrastructure to generate and exploit data for\nunderstanding biological processes at the molecular level from cells to\nsingle molecules. Critical to fully realising the potential of the\nimaging data from this variety of complementary imaging methods is\nscalable and robust management, processing, visualisation and\ninterpretation of this information.</p>\n<p>OCTOPUS will use ICAT to store and manage its wide variety of both raw\ndata and processed data, using a customised web interface building on\nTopCAT, linking this with management of data processing and\nvisualisation on STFC computing facilities through a new service, the\nICAT Job Portal (IJP). Metadata is extracted from files and added to the\ncatalogue for searchability. This will be integrated with other systems,\nsuch as OMERO, so that additional services can be provided to OCTOPUS\nusers.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"OCTOPUS","date":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/collaboration/facilities/octopus/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2186722355","3212510956","3248290905","3649515864","4121107168"],"slicesMap":{}}
