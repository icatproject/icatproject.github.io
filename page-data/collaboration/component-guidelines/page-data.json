This\nrequires that the pom.xml is configured correctly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Installation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Installation scripts should be in python compatible with versions\n2.4 to 2.7</li>\n<li>The normal installation mechanism is to download a file\nxxxxx-n.n.n-distro.zip, unpack it and run <em>setup.py install</em> and\nuninstalled by <em>setup.py uninstall</em>.
