WHich roles are defined?</p>\n<p>Andy Q: How will citations be tracked?</p>\n<p>Andy Q: Do you plan to support machines downloading data?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>potential problem of robots downloading all data and restoring data from tape</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alex Q: do you plan to allow users to create DOIs for data that's not their own?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>unsure, we're gathering reqs right now, but probably not initially</li>\n<li>Rolf: idea - use the original data DOI normally as a reference</li>\n<li>Restricting to DOI to just PIs - original data should have a DOI, if it doesn't then contact the original authors to create a DOI</li>\n<li>Andy: but what if you only use a few files?</li>\n<li>ESRF only allows users to mint their own data as well - Alex says this Q has been around for a while</li>\n<li>Patrick - users could \"make up\" the list of DOI authors</li>\n<li>ESRF allows anyone involved in an investigation to create a DOI, PI was too restrictive</li>\n<li>Rolf provides a random url for reviewers to see data before publication</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Patrick Q: Regarding being able (or not) to \"supplement\" with additional data - when we release a new version of software for the Muon Spectroscopy Computational Project, we create a DOI (on Zenodo) for the version but we also maintain a \"concept\" DOI which always points to the most recent version and never changes. Is this an approach that was considered or might be useful?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>people are not citing data</li>\n</ul>\n<h3></h3>\n<p>Rolf - HZB PIDs</p>\n<ul>\n<li>distinction between raw data &#x26; data publications</li>\n<li>Raw data don't have DOIs - instead they have \"handles\" - DataCites schema but not a DOI. Also doesn't set the creator - as they don't know who has made a \"genuine scientific contribution\" (DataCites definition of author). Rather set nothing than be wrong</li>\n<li>Proposal users are set as contributors &#x26; their roles are listed - the roles don't map onto DataCite roles</li>\n<li>example handle page: <a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/21.11151/ezmb-fune?noredirect\">http://hdl.handle.net/21.11151/ezmb-fune?noredirect</a></li>\n<li>also handles for data under embargo</li>\n<li>the handles mostly use DataCite metadata, including standardise terms</li>\n<li>Data Publications are separate things - users need to submit data publications like submitting to a journal - not \"easy &#x26; automatic\"</li>\n<li>example data publication: <a href=\"https://data.helmholtz-berlin.de/pub/ND000009\">https://data.helmholtz-berlin.de/pub/ND000009</a></li>\n<li>for download, they provide a 'request download' which stages the data from tape, and turns into a download link, not entirely machine actionable</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Q by Kevin - how many of these you have?</p>\n<p>a lot of manual work at the moment, so only few, we don't advertise this service a lot\nwe need to do some scripting with lots of supporting hints</p>\n<p>Q by AGB - have you got the use case of enabling reviewers to see the data during the embargo period?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rolf: reserve a DOI internally (not a draft DOI), random URL points to draft, once they're happy publish it properly. Could use draft DOIs.</li>\n<li>Alex: reviewers could share it to non-authorised users. Rolf: that's a risk with everything that's sent to reviewers!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Alex de Maria's talk</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>processed data - it is not raw data, could be reduced data</li>\n<li>raw data is the first data we keep</li>\n<li>data policy will be extended to include processed data</li>\n<li>processed data is already in ICAT (e.g. because users want DOIs for it) but this is done manually</li>\n<li>beamlines now organise their experiment folder into raw_data and processed_data folders</li>\n<li>want to display processed data nicely</li>\n<li>expecting demand to increase</li>\n<li>have to standardise the beamlines &#x26; facility, e.g. above folder structure, 1 folder = 1 dataset to be able to automate</li>\n<li>lots of relations of processed data linked to raw dara</li>\n<li>How to link datasets in ICAT: <em><strong>Jobs</strong></em></li>\n<li>Using Jobs table might not be performant though...</li>\n<li>So instead use \"soft links\" using dataset parameters i.e. <code>input_dataset_id</code>/<code>output_dataset_id</code></li>\n<li>application data also stored in dataset paramters in the processed dataset</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alejandra Q: is Job perfomance issue theoretical or tested? Alex: theoretical. Rolf: you should do measurements - Jobs might be better or equal as you're utilising the DB.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>instruments give the input_dataset as a path, ingestion uses this to populate dataset parameter IDs</li>\n<li>processed data can be ingested before the raw data which can be a problem - just have to design ingestor to handle this. If processed data is recieved before do nothing with it yet, wait for raw data</li>\n<li>denormalising dataset parameters to increase read performance at the expense of write performance - aka putting all the info from multiple tables into dataset parameters</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Patrick Q: how well defined are these denormalised parameters? Alex: see next slide. Beamlines can't define new parameters - Alex's team defines the parameters.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Based on technique, display different visualisation in the frontend</li>\n<li>Thumbnails associated with datasets are always online so they can be used by the frontend</li>\n<li>processed data displayed as tabs on the dataset infomation pages</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/WWbCx9h.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Patrick Q: how would the frontend display processed data if 2 raw datasets were used to create it. Alex: it depends, generally the beamlines choose which dataset they want to attach it to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dataset parameters are defined using a Nexus-like convention.</li>\n<li>If someone wants a new parameter they need to request it gets added</li>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Patrick Q (not asked yet): Is there the use case to identify how the input/output dataset was used? I.E. the first output is a plaintext file, the second is a png plot.</p>\n<p>Patrick Q: How do you achieve 1:N with DatasetParameters? Uniqueness for DatasetParameter is dataset and type.\nA: <code>input_dataset</code> is a list</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ISPYB database - 20 years ago for MX, and then extended</li>\n<li>few years ago they decided to change the backend from Java to python</li>\n<li>consider to use ICAT to do the same, tables will be simpler</li>\n<li>they are doing the exercise to map from ISPYB to ICAT</li>\n<li>worflow - a mix of data acquisition and processing activities</li>\n<li>can these be mapped into ICAT? 3 potential approaches</li>\n<li>as a proof of concept they are putting all the information as DatasetParameters</li>\n<li>ingest the data with soft links</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Steve Collins Q: how do you tell what datafiles are processed or raw? Kevin: the have separate folders saying raw and processed. Alex: 1 dataset per folder, and in the ingestor it links it all together</p>\n<h2>Metadata</h2>\n<h3>Rolf - Dataset Parameters at HZB</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Problem: lack of standardisation of parameters across facilities - this makes pan-searching hard/impossible</li>\n<li>Goal?: common PaN Metadata standard (could also use in OAI-PMH</li>\n<li>ICAT schema imposes a global list of parameter names</li>\n<li>Start from NeXus files</li>\n<li>no application definition but using base classes</li>\n<li>NeXus are working on NeXus ontology - might be able to use this in the future to translate queries</li>\n<li>Considerations: same parameter should use the same type across instruments, need naming convention that works across instruments, standardise units (don't create temp C and temp K e.g)</li>\n<li>Suggestion: use flattened NeXus path as parameter name, add numerical suffix if two the same, stick to SI units w/o SI prefixes</li>\n<li>agree on a common subset of parameter types across facilities</li>\n<li>who would use it? we can't impose this on communities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Andy - be aware that the NeXus application definitions are not adopted by (m)any user communities. They cannot be used as a standard yet. The problem is especially acute for processed data where we are lacking Nexus application definitions as well as when there exist very few sites are using them.</p>\n<h3>Experiment parameters at ESRF - Marjolaine</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Experiment parameters are stored at dataset level</li>\n<li>Investigation params are only \"information\" e.g. how many files etc.</li>\n<li>XML file describing mapping between ICAT and master HDF5 formar</li>\n<li>TechniqueName_ParameterName</li>\n<li>is storing all params at dataset level the \"right\" way?</li>\n<li>Samples: user portal synchronises info to ICAT along with some sample params</li>\n<li>Also samples come from data acquision</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rolf Q: 1 sample sheet maps to single sample? Kind of yeah, but also create a \"super\" Sample</p>\n<p>SampleType could map to SampleSheet better perhaps, but Alex says there's a problem in that SampleType is shared across the facility - he'd like it to be for investigation.</p>\n<p>proposal of ICAT schema change? SampleType is currently at Facility level, ESRF would prefer this to be at the Investigation level (use case around safety information)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CSV uploads for experiment and processing plan - where to put it in ICAT?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Steve Collins</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>use cases\n<ul>\n<li>data owner data search - search their own data</li>\n<li>open data search - findability - searching all of the data</li>\n<li>data processing - interoperability</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>the first use case is the most important</li>\n<li>third use case is not a high priority</li>\n<li>for searching, we only have administrative metadata at the moment</li>\n<li>we want to work on experimental parameters: NeXuS terms, sample description, other?</li>\n<li>short-term - develop a small set of parameters, using persistent identifiers, NeXuS ontology and also units</li>\n<li>Challenges\n<ul>\n<li>search for their own data in real time - while they are processing the data\n<ul>\n<li>issue with ingesting data later</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>how to deal with samples, no standards no community approach\n<ul>\n<li>very high priority - not addressed because it is difficult</li>\n<li>have multiple local definitions - not consistent or FAIR</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>general approach to labelling with ontologies</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>triples in ICAT</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rolf: we have techniques table but don't specify the predicate, we assume the relation is dataset x is made using technique y. Do we need the general case? Maybe...</p>\n<h3>Kevin - Samples @ ISIS &#x26; DLS</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Both use similar process</li>\n<li>Free text name for sample names given by user</li>\n<li>Attached to investigations</li>\n<li>Samples aren't attached to datasets</li>\n<li>Safety info @ ISIS gets attached as sample parameters</li>\n<li>DataGateway only displays the sample name (as that's all we really have)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rolf: Is it accurate re: number of samples? Kevin: don't think we even record that info, just recording sample type info for safety reasons.\nAlex: with sample tracking, you need to be a lot more specific e.g. protein with different solutions with different concentrations. Can be complex and require using multiple separate systems\nMalik: store info as a datafile as a standardised file name\nRolf: big plans for samples, but only at beginning of discussion</p>\n<h2>Performance</h2>\n<h3>Kevin - ICAT vs SciCat benchmarking</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Work done in 2019, findings were presented at last ICAT F2F in 2020</li>\n<li>simulated metadata grown over 6 years by adding half a billion (10^9) each year</li>\n<li>ran some test queries (e.g. frontend my data view, frontend browsing, ingestion)</li>\n<li>5.5 x 10^9 files</li>\n<li>simple tests results: ~0.01s</li>\n<li>done via entityManager and icat.client</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Q: did Kevin take database caching into account? No, but did 90 users doing different requests for different datasets</p>\n<ul>\n<li>wasn't a constant increase</li>\n<li>more complex rules incur a performance overhead</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alex: does DLS have datafile parameters? No</p>\n<ul>\n<li>long queries werent a constant increase either</li>\n<li>Overall conclusion: rise is insignificant enough for the next 5-10 years</li>\n<li>SciCat testing: can't recreate the long query test as you can't paginate/filter datafiles</li>\n<li>SciCat essentially assumes datasets have few files (as they don't provide filtering, sorting, pagination facilities to actually be able to find files in a large dataset)</li>\n<li>Limit of ~3000 proposals per user</li>\n<li>Limit of ~100000 files per Dataset\n<ul>\n<li>Diamond has lots more than this sometimes (also this isn't good, it needs supporting for historical reasons)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>ICAT was faster on average</li>\n<li>SciCat also scales okay over the next 5-10 yrs</li>\n<li>DLS &#x26; STFC had multiple reasons to stick with ICAT vs SciCat</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Patrick: ICAT Rules</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>what</code> in a rule is the main part of a rule</li>\n<li>Shorter rules (literally by character length) are evaluated first</li>\n<li>PublicTables don't require a database call, used for things like e.g. <code>Facility</code></li>\n<li>PublicSteps, <code>origin</code> and <code>field</code>, means if you can read <code>origin</code>, you can read <code>field</code> without further evaluating rules</li>\n<li>GateKeeper does the majority of the work</li>\n<li>we need the granularity of the ICAT rules to be able to support our data policies - e.g. distinction between raw and processed data</li>\n<li>Examples of long queries caused by rules</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/icatproject/ids.server/issues/115\">https://github.com/icatproject/ids.server/issues/115</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/icatproject/ids.server/issues/117\">https://github.com/icatproject/ids.server/issues/117</a></li>\n<li>Lucene authorization\n<ul>\n<li>Checks permissions for every single entity</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Should timeout long search</li>\n<li>Cache PublicSteps &#x26; PublicTables in Lucence</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alejandra: high level summary - you need to pay attention to your Rules. They have a big impact on the performance of getting data out of ICAT</p>\n<p>Rolf: observation - most of our rules are based on the investigation, caching what investigations users are allowed to see would massively increase performance. But how to do that! rules hierarchy? datafile rules that cites a rule on investigation to give ICAT a hint.</p>\n<p>Alex: ICAT+ caches investigation list to increase performance.\nKevin: it doesn't work with a user with lots of investigations but that was a long time ago.</p>\n<p>Andy Q: what are the performance bottlenecks which we could encounter if we increase the number of simulataneous users + number of datasets and datasets parameters?</p>\n<p>rules for each user type should not be complicated</p>\n<p>Andy Q: what is the STFC hardware configuration for the DLS+ISIS ICAT?</p>\n<p>Andy Q: are there some ideas on how to re-organise the Datafiles tables to reduce it?</p>\n<h3>Front-end session</h3>\n<h4>DataGateway -
