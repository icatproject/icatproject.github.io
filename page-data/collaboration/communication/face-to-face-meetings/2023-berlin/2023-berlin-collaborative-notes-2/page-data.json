Using it as an example fill the DB with needed parameters first</li>\n<li>Current SESAME approach:\n<ul>\n<li>Inserting facility, instrument, parameterType using SQL directly</li>\n<li>Using icatingest to import an icatdump file</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Currently, the restricted formats are in a private repository. They are HZB specific. Notices that the core functionality could be moved to python-icat?</p>\n<h3>How difficult is it to deploy ICAT?</h3>\n<p>Rolf: install process is simple, provide config files and run setup. It is as easy as it can get. Difficulty is providing the configuration files. For some this is easier than others.</p>\n<p>Kevin: there are a few gotchas: placing the jar for the DB in the right directory for example.</p>\n<p>Andy: the install guide is out of date? Probably?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Yes it refers directly to glassfish 4. <a href=\"https://github.com/icatproject/icat.manual/blob/master/tutorials\">icat.manual</a> is better as it refers to payara5, but even still referes to icat4 rather than icat5. We should be able to fairly painlessly migrate the icat.manual markdown onto the GH pages for the website.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Docker image might be easier but is currently undocumented. Do we want something similar for the dockerfile (to prevent it from becoming a black box)?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Two things:\n<ul>\n<li>Elementary documentation, what the config options are etc.</li>\n<li>Aside from that, want a tutorial like the ICAT manual but for the docker approach</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>CI for icat components run using Ansible scripts (developed by STFC)</p>\n<p>Dockerfile is in a way self documenting...</p>\n<p>There are different target groups for our documentation here: beginers or more advanced</p>\n<p>How can the optional bits of the ICAT stack be indentified and made clear to a new user/developer?</p>\n<h2>Misc Tech bits</h2>\n<h3>Patrick - search</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Free text search goes via icat.server REST API</li>\n<li>icat.server calls icat.lucene\n<ul>\n<li>icat.lucene doesn't know re: rules</li>\n<li>so icat.server needs to evaluate rules on search results</li>\n<li>calls icat.lucene again if more results needed (if user can't see enough)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>the search call to icat.server only returns IDs, so frontends need to call icat.server entityManager to get entity info from IDs</li>\n<li>User wants to search on parameters and samples and other related entities</li>\n<li>Need to return e.g. instrument data along with results</li>\n<li>Facets:\n<ul>\n<li>e.g. temp 80degC, date between, sample name = CeO2</li>\n<li>have user select from predefined options to shrink results set e.g. like when shopping</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Synonyms, e.g. Fe = Iron\n<ul>\n<li>synonym injection (e.g. ionising = ionizing)</li>\n<li>can make common stop words searchable e.g. as, be (which double as elements)</li>\n<li>needs configuration</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Diamond file limit, more than 2^32 integer limit\n<ul>\n<li>Manually route ingested files based on date/IDs (multiple indexes)</li>\n<li>you get this for free in elasticsearch via sharding</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>performance: improve the performance by batching authorisation</li>\n<li>Aside: need good metadata\n<ul>\n<li>chicken and egg, if we don't develop features bc there's no good metadata, then people won't bother to curate good metadata</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>All popular search engines use Lucene (ES, opensearch, solr)</li>\n<li>Any option is viable with new ICAT search solution, using lucene just misses some nice to have features</li>\n<li>ElasticSearch/OpenSearch\n<ul>\n<li>nodes, only need 1 but ideally 3 for resilience</li>\n<li>more nodes = more performance or specialisation, e.g. master, ingest etc.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Sharding, each index needs >=1 primary shard</li>\n<li>each primary shard can have replica shards</li>\n<li>balanced between nodes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>implementation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>lucenemanager was linked to lucene API</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>new SearchManager which is engine independent</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>SearchAPI class contains common functionality, and created LuceneAPI which talks to icat.lucene and OpensearchAPI can conenct to ElasticSearch/Opensearch</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Performance improvements</p>\n<ul>\n<li>get all metadata from search, removes need for second API call</li>\n<li>IDs authorised in batched</li>\n<li>Set request timeout</li>\n<li>optionally return early if we have enough data</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>UI changes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>couldn't order results by most relevant in old method</li>\n<li>simplified UI</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>can do unit converation if you configure it</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>explained that there is no equivalent icat.elasticsearch - you just point icat.server at the elasticsearch server</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rolf: Can we add an equivalent \"Open\" search option that adds a criteria like the \"MyData\" search? With the criteria being configurable?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In principle yes, however this requires anything the \"Open\" query relies on being indexed - e.g. releaseDate, doi...\n<ul>\n<li>Don't know if this is currently the case - it would be best to indexed everything that would be useful so we don't have to re-index everything later when we realise we don't have everything we need</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Config location? Could add it in DG but might be better for DG to just pass a boolean and icat.server to handle the specifics</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alex dM: Can the entities indexed be controlled? If only interested in Datasets, and specific DatasetParameters (~6 valuable ones, the rest are not interesting)?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/icatproject/icat.server/blob/e05db060a8a44b6e0ae620c4010b7645d5ee8aee/src/main/resources/run.properties#L26\">entitiesToIndex</a> is a config option in ICAT server. Only these will be indexed by Lucene/the search engine backend. This config option will still be present in the \"new\" version of free text search.</li>\n<li>Currently, all Parameters are stored in their own index (one for Investigation, Dataset, Datafile and Sample). When searching/faceting, under the hood we \"join\" the main entity index to the Parameter index.</li>\n<li>Joining has a negative performance impact, but is the only way to retain nested lists of objects (i.e. the only way to keep the type.name, type.units associated with the same numericValue)</li>\n<li>In your use case, where there are certain valuable Parameters, it would be better to (as you have already done) \"flatten\" these parameters into fields on the Dataset document, as you do not need to worry about needing to be able to update these Parameters or an explosion in the number of Parameter fields.\n<ul>\n<li>This is <strong>not</strong> currently possible in either the icat.lucene or the OS/ES backend support, however in principle it should be possible to do by writing additional logic (and would be more performant) providing you don't mind the following drawbacks:\n<ul>\n<li>Parameters need to be reduced to key:value pairs, so units would need to be embedded into either the key or the value, rangeTop/rangeBottom would need to be mapped to a single value etc.</li>\n<li>You would not be able to easily modify the \"ParameterType\" information - e.g. to change the ParameterType.name would mean changing the mapping of the entire index, or adding an alias for the field which would need very specific logic compared to the rest of the functionality</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Viktor - Search API (&#x26; DataGateway API)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>flask based REST API (python)</li>\n<li>fetched data in ICAT either via python-icat or via a database (latter only for testing)</li>\n<li>Designed for use with DataGateway</li>\n<li>Requires authentication (ICAT session ID)</li>\n<li>Search API\n<ul>\n<li>allows access public data from ICAT catalogues</li>\n<li>designed to be integrated in the EOSC (european open science cloud)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>because we could reuse dg-api logic to make search api, they live in the same codebase</li>\n<li>allows searching documents, datasets and instruments but can include some other entities</li>\n<li>uses loopback REST query filters\n<ul>\n<li>easy for those using loopback and node</li>\n<li>no python equivalent</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>search-api entities don't map exactly to ICAT entities\n<ul>\n<li>so have configurable JSON mapping file</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>codebase has two APIs\n<ul>\n<li>each one can be configured to be on or off, so can choose to just run one or both</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>endpoints are separate</li>\n<li>separate swagger documents</li>\n</ul>\n<p>recent work</p>\n<ul>\n<li>JSON config -> YAML config</li>\n<li>ICAT 5 work</li>\n<li>updated test data generator script</li>\n<li>increased test coverage for DB</li>\n<li>Support for scoring Search API results\n<ul>\n<li>waiting on PaNOSC search component to update to work with larger datasets (10000 investigaitons)</li>\n<li>uses RAM to process data</li>\n<li>this is the only thing blocking ISIS results going into PaN portal</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>app has now been dockerised\n<ul>\n<li>in a branch still right now</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>future work</p>\n<ul>\n<li>general technical debt maintenance work (package updates, updating documentation, dropping old python versions)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rolf: python 3.6, some effort required as in his docker image it's the default python version\nAlex: do you think we should add authentication to the PaNOSC search API?
