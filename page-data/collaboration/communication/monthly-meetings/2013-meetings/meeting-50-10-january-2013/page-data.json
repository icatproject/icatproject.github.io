See\nactions 50.01 and 50.02.</p>\n<p>Milan reported that he was working on a deliverable for WP4 of Pandata,\nbut requires data from Thorsten in DESY. Thorsten is still on vacation\nand so the deliverable will be delayed until the data is available. He\nis expecting to use the data for the next service verification on 1\nFebruary. When this has occurred, the deliverable can be completed.</p>\n<p>Steve reported that he was considering including some speculative\nfeatures in ICAT 4.3. These speculative features are being introduced to\nsupport data mining and they may change or be removed from future ICATs.\nThere was discussion about how to achieve this. The meeting did not\nagree any particular mechanism. It was proposed that odd numbered minor\nrevisions such as 4.3 may contain such features, but even numbered\nrevisions such as 4.2 and 4.4 do not. A facility using ICAT would\nnormally go from even to even. However where a Facility requires a\nspeculative feature, then it may deploy an odd version on the\nunderstanding that the interface to the speculative feature may change.\nSee action 50.03.</p>\n<p>The meeting finished at 15:30.</p>\n<h3>Attendance 50</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Init</td>\n<td>Name</td>\n<td>Institute</td>\n<td>Present</td>\n<td>Apologies</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>AM</td>\n<td>Alistair Mills</td>\n<td>STFC SCD</td>\n<td>+</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SF</td>\n<td>Steve Fisher</td>\n<td>STFC SCD</td>\n<td>+</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>KP</td>\n<td>Kevin Phipps</td>\n<td>STFC SCD</td>\n<td>+</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>MP</td>\n<td>Milan Prica</td>\n<td>ELETTRA</td>\n<td>+</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GK</td>\n<td>George Kourousias</td>\n<td>ELETTRA</td>\n<td>+</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SR</td>\n<td>Shelly Ren</td>\n<td>ORNL SNS</td>\n<td>+</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Actions 50</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Item</td>\n<td>Description</td>\n<td>Res**(1)**</td>\n<td>Status</td>\n<td>Comment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>50.00</td>\n<td>Document the meeting</td>\n<td>AM</td>\n<td>Done</td>\n<td>–</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>50.01</td>\n<td>Provide additional information about venue, hotel, contacts for Sweden</td>\n<td>AM</td>\n<td>.</td>\n<td>–</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>50.02</td>\n<td>Update the page on the wiki with information about Sweden</td>\n<td>AM</td>\n<td>on-going</td>\n<td>–</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>50.03</td>\n<td>Consider a mechanism for introducing speculative features to ICAT</td>\n<td>SF</td>\n<td>Done</td>\n<td>–</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>50.04</td>\n<td>Call next meeting for 24 January 2013</td>\n<td>AM</td>\n<td>Done</td>\n<td>–</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","frontmatter":{"title":"Meeting 50 – 10 January 2013","date":"2013-01-10T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/collaboration/communication/monthly-meetings/2013-meetings/meeting-50-10-january-2013/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2186722355","3212510956","3248290905","3649515864","4121107168"],"slicesMap":{}}
