Yes</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sample tracking</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://doodle.com/meeting/participate/id/bqZ4v8Gd\">https://doodle.com/meeting/participate/id/bqZ4v8Gd</a>\nAllan to orgnaise. Deadline for filling form for next Monday - send reminder then.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sirius has a problem with some beamline which want sample tracking (SAXS, powder diffraction and tomography beamlines)</li>\n<li>ESRF have a WIP tracking solution which joins the ispyb and ICAT Samples</li>\n<li>Good time for discussion for if (Sirius) can collaborate on this</li>\n<li>Andy: see no problem with supporting multiple techniques\n<ul>\n<li>Allan: is this feasible? does it make sense to have information for the different domains in the same interface</li>\n<li>Alex: when the samples are sent to the synchotron, we want to know where the sample is and also describe it. Parameters are determined by the acquisition panel - (temperate etc.) also processing parameters (what has been done). This is more than just \"sample tracking\" in terms of location.\n<ul>\n<li>Allan: Sirius has two beamlines that do want to know T and other physical parameters. Special case at Sirius for safety of the sample - user needs to fill in a form to assure the safety of the sample at Sirius. Want a way of extracting this information. What is the pipeline from user sending the sample to then sending the form - how are other synchotrons doing this?</li>\n<li>Alex: Have safety concerns as well. Have a <a href=\"https://confluence.esrf.fr/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=PROJSAMPLETRACKING&#x26;title=Parcel+status+diagram\">diagram</a> showing the process.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Alejandra: we are also interested in how people are doing this and want to know if the description of samples can be standardised and shared.\n<ul>\n<li>Kirsty: there is interest/progress along these lines at DLS as well (but Kirsty is not the person to ask about it)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Java versions</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-support-roadmap.html\">https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-support-roadmap.html</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Might be worth waiting for Rolf as he raised this.</li>\n<li>Discussion ongoing via the mailing list</li>\n<li>Pros/cons of running 11/17 in production?\n<ul>\n<li>Rolf wants to see \"results\" - i.e. a conclusion on what to use</li>\n<li>ESRF have no plans - using Java 8 and if it is not necessary do not want to change</li>\n<li>Alan: Payara supports 11, 17, 21, move to 17?</li>\n<li>Allan: has concerns about security of 11</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-support-roadmap.html\">https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-support-roadmap.html</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Site updates</h2>\n<h3>ESRF: Alex</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Still working on supporting crystallography with ICAT</li>\n<li>Goal is to have one beamline simultaneously on ICAT and ispyb</li>\n<li>Support for running workflows and the results ending up in ICAT\n<ul>\n<li>Workflow could mean anything. Could run on the edge (beamline) or the cluster</li>\n<li>Alejandra: what is the script?

To prevent fututre attacks the network infrastructure of the institute external facing tools are being discussed. ICAT will not be online until this is resolved.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>ALBA: No-one present</h3>\n<h3>Sirius: Allan</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Almost finished K8s infrastructure but no update to give</li>\n<li>In November want to have ICAT running in production - good time as a nation attempting data standardisation - two techniques</li>\n<li>Andy: installing ICAT+?
