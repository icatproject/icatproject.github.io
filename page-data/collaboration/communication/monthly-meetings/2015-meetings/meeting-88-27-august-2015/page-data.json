A new restful call to\nobtain properties has been added to return everything useful\nthat doesn’t need authentication, including info about\nauthenticators which can be used by tools such as topcat. The ESCAPE\nkeyword now works in JPQL queries. The lucene searching targetting\ntopcat is under way.</li>\n<li>Brian has started to use python-icat for some IJP job scripts. He\nneeds to be able to use an existing ICAT sessionId and ensure that\nthe client does not close the session on termination. He will\ndiscuss this with Rolf.</li>\n<li>The ids.smartclient has needed a few changes to make it work well\nwith topcat. This could now be released but will first be tested on\nOS X.</li>\n<li>webdav for ids. Kevin is on leave but Tom reported that testing with\nvery large file transfers gave session timeout problems .</li>\n<li>The backend (for the “Angular topcat” is mostly done. There is still\nan issue that getStatus requires a sessionId and Wayne would like\nthe option to not require it.</li>\n<li>IJP needs uodating to work with latest ICAT and IDS.</li>\n<li>For the icat dashboard, in the absence of Alex, Tom reported that\nfeedback on the plans would be appreciated. Steve has already\ncirculated a suggestion that the presentation layer should bve a\nseparate component. The ids will need to produce some kind of record\nof what it has been doing.</li>\n<li>Steve reported that he was obtaining a license for MireDot (free for\nopen source projects) to generate documentation for the ids.server\nand for the restful interface  to the</li>\n</ul>\n<p>icat.server.</p>\n<h1>Actions</h1>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>ITEM</td>\n<td>DESCRIPTION</td>\n<td>ASSIGNED</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>88.0</td>\n<td>Discuss use of existing icat sessions in python-icat with Rolf.</td>\n<td>Brian</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>87.0</td>\n<td>Run DOI script for all recent releases.</td>\n<td>Steve</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>87.1</td>\n<td>Test installation on OS X</td>\n<td>Steve</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>87.5</td>\n<td>Give permission to Rolf to allow write access to ICAT repositry</td>\n<td>Steve</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>85.2</td>\n<td>Provide an example ICAT facility page for ISIS in icatproject.org</td>\n<td>Tom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>85.3</td>\n<td>Migrate ICAT Manager to the ICAT project GitHub</td>\n<td>Christophe/Andy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>81.0</td>\n<td>Report bug in eclipselink</td>\n<td>Steve</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>74.0</td>\n<td>Look into JDBC connector resilience with Wildfly</td>\n<td>Steve</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","frontmatter":{"title":"Meeting 88 – 27 August 2015","date":"2015-08-27T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/collaboration/communication/monthly-meetings/2015-meetings/meeting-88-27-august-2015/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2186722355","3212510956","3248290905","3649515864","4121107168"],"slicesMap":{}}
