It is on a public GitHub repo –\nnot the ICAT one yet as it is still a bit CLF specific to be of\nwider use. It will be modified to make it work for ISIS shortly.</li>\n<li>ICAT Dashboard development has started. The IDS will log using JMS\nso that the dashboard gets the data it needs. Steve is proposing to\nmove ICAT call logging to JMS as well.</li>\n<li>The ICAT installer now works first time since a fix in ICAT 4.5.1.</li>\n<li>Steve has been having problems with JMS in Wildfly and has updated\nto a later version which has less problems. He hopes to have an ICAT\nrunning on Wildfly in about a week’s time.</li>\n<li>Rolf has just reported and issue with TopCAT V2 following on from\nthe conversation on the</li>\n</ul>\n<p>icatgroup.</p>\n<h1>Actions</h1>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>ITEM</td>\n<td>DESCRIPTION</td>\n<td>ASSIGNED</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>90.0</td>\n<td>Make the software to restore files from the IDS to a local filesystem/HPC cluster available to the ICAT community</td>\n<td>Frazer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>89.1</td>\n<td>Provide feedback on icat.server 4.6.0 snapshot (relating to Lucene search API)</td>\n<td>Jody</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>88.0</td>\n<td>Discuss use of existing icat sessions in python-icat with Rolf.</td>\n<td>Brian</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>85.2</td>\n<td>Provide an example ICAT facility page for ISIS in icatproject.org</td>\n<td>Tom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>85.3</td>\n<td>Migrate ICAT Manager to the ICAT project GitHub</td>\n<td>Andy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>81.0</td>\n<td>Report bug in eclipselink</td>\n<td>Steve</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>74.0</td>\n<td>Look into JDBC connector resilience with Wildfly</td>\n<td>Steve</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","frontmatter":{"title":"Meeting 90 – 22 October 2015","date":"2015-10-22T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/collaboration/communication/monthly-meetings/2015-meetings/meeting-90--22-october-2015/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2186722355","3212510956","3248290905","3649515864","4121107168"],"slicesMap":{}}
