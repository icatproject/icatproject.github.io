Peter has added them to\ngithub but still needs to put them into the ICAT organization area.</p>\n<p>Action 89.1 Provide feedback on icat.server 4.6.0 snapshot (relating to\nLucene search API).  Jody explained how the search works well but there\nare a few minor issues that require further communication with Steve.</p>\n<p>Action 81.0 Steve has reported 3 bugs in eclipselink.

The release\nincludes some important improvements. Rolf would like to move to a\nmajor release 1.0 but this would require more user feedback.</li>\n<li>Rolf is going to create and post a user survey on python ICAT in\nJanuary to gather feedback.</li>\n<li>Steve is putting in JMS calls for the IDS to allow the Dashboard to\ngather information on what the IDS is being used for. The JMS\nlogging will be for all calls.</li>\n<li>The TopCAT in development can now combine columns on browsing. You\ncan also specify custom templates for cells and a custom JPQL\nexpression for the combining of columns.</li>\n<li>The Dashboard now has a full stack skeleton with some data being\ndisplayed in graphs. Development is being pushed to fill out the\nSkeleton for the first sprint review meeting at the end of January.</li>\n<li>Tom reported on the recent ICAT steering group meeting.
