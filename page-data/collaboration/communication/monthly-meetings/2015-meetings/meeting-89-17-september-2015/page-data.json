During testing Steve found that\nglassfish 4.0 doesn’t work with OS X which mean glassfish 4.2 would have\nto be used. ICAT however, doesn’t work with 4.2 so Steve proposes to\nwait for the WildFly configuation to be ready.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Steve has made available a ICAT 4.6 SNAPSHOT.  He is currently\nwaiting for feedback from Wayne about the Lucene calls.</li>\n<li>Steve has updated the authenticators to include the new\ngetDescription calls. These are also available as SNAPSHOTS.</li>\n<li>Steve has given Rolf a login to the repository but Rolf still\nrequires an area.</li>\n<li>Rolf had concerns that the ICAT might be leaning away from SOAP and\nas python-icat is a SOAP client this could mean having to change the\ncode base. Steve commented on how ICAT will continue to have the\noption of using SOAP which answered Rolfs concerns.</li>\n<li>Steve has released the ids.smartclient with .debian,  .rpm and .exe\nfor windows. Steve is not far off from making a .pkg for OS X.</li>\n<li>In Kevin’s absence Tom reported on webdav, informing the team that\nit will be out for testing within the next few weeks for CLF.</li>\n<li>Wayne has released a V1.13 SNAPSHOT last week. This has added\nsupport for ICAT v4.5.</li>\n<li>TopCat V2 is currently working with Https, globus and smartclient.\nThere is currently an issue with Firefox and TopCat V2 that Wayne is\ncurrently investigating. There will be a Beta release of TopCat V2\nsoon.</li>\n<li>Alex reported on the requirements meeting with ISIS for ICAT\ndashboard. No new requirements were captured.</li>\n<li>Steve will be producing an updated installer once Topcat 1.13.0 is\nno longer a SNAPSHOT.</li>\n<li>Steve is currently working on the Wildfly container and all is going\nwell so</li>\n</ul>\n<p>far.</p>\n<h1>Actions</h1>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>ITEM</td>\n<td>DESCRIPTION</td>\n<td>ASSIGNED</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>89.0</td>\n<td>Steve to create area on github for ICAT dashboard.</td>\n<td>Steve</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>89.1</td>\n<td>Provide feedback on icat.server 4.6.0 snapshot</td>\n<td>Wayne</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>88.0</td>\n<td>Discuss use of existing icat sessions in python-icat with Rolf.</td>\n<td>Brian</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>87.5</td>\n<td>Give permission to Rolf to allow write access to ICAT repositry</td>\n<td>Steve</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>85.2</td>\n<td>Provide an example ICAT facility page for ISIS in icatproject.org</td>\n<td>Tom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>85.3</td>\n<td>Migrate ICAT Manager to the ICAT project GitHub</td>\n<td>Christophe/Andy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>81.0</td>\n<td>Report bug in eclipselink</td>\n<td>Steve</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>74.0</td>\n<td>Look into JDBC connector resilience with Wildfly</td>\n<td>Steve</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","frontmatter":{"title":"Meeting 89 – 17 September 2015","date":"2015-09-17T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/collaboration/communication/monthly-meetings/2015-meetings/meeting-89-17-september-2015/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2186722355","3212510956","3248290905","3649515864","4121107168"],"slicesMap":{}}
