Once the updates have been\ncompleted the layout mockups will be circulated to all interested\nparties for approval.</li>\n<li>Action 82.4: After a lot of communication with BitRock Steve has\nestablished the issue to be caused by the way that Python handles\nsubprocesses within Windows. Steve will add calls to the installer\nthe are normally handled by the python setup script to overcome this\nissue. Currently the only component affected is the\nids.storage_file.</li>\n<li>Action 82.5: The F2F meeting agenda has been released and the\nmailing list has been informed.</li>\n<li>Action 81.1: Currently in preparation and will be circulated prior\nto the F2F meeting.</li>\n<li>Steve has begun development on ICAT 4.5.0 with lucene based\nsearching for use by TopCAT.</li>\n<li>ICAT 4.4.0 has been found to not support selects of the form “SELECT\na.b FROM…” where b is not a simple attribute. This was never\ndocumented as a feature and therefore has never been tested, however\nit used to work in versions of ICAT prior to 4.4.0. This has been\nfixed and tested in 4.5.0 and so far appears to be successful.</li>\n<li>Steve may possibly release ICAT 4.5.0 without the lucene calls to\naddress bug fixes in 4.4.0. The TopCAT matching lucene calls would\nthen be delayed to version 4.6.0. Everyone was happy with this\napproach.</li>\n<li>A new version of ICAT Manager is to be released in the upcoming\nmonth. There will be some small additional features and bug fixes\nbut no major changes to functionality.</li>\n<li>A new version (0.7.0) of Python-ICAT has been released. There is\nmostly only one change: a new module icat.query with a class Query\nhave been added.  This class can be used to build ICAT search\nexpressions.  Instances of the class may be used in place of search\nexpression strings where appropriate.Using the Query class can\nimprove readability of your Python code. Currently no plans to add\nnew features to Python-ICAT or bug fixes required.</li>\n<li>Version 1.3.1 of the IDS has been released. This includes a fix to a\nbug causing file handled remaining open for individually downloaded\nfiles.</li>\n<li>Version 1.3.1 of the ids.storage_file has been released. This\nincludes a fix to to a bug in the algorithm that chooses which files\nto archive.</li>\n<li>Steve is to provide a new IDS bug fix soon for an issue related the\nfile checking. Currently the file that holds the last ID checked can\nbe corrupted.</li>\n<li>Steve, in conjunction with DLS, are currently investigating various\nmethods for alternate download method for the IDS. One option being\na new component that makes calls to the IDS via the use of the\ngetLink call and then pushing the data via a choice of mechanisms.\nThis may be one component or several that make use a shared library.\nAnother option is a client that can be run by the user that is user\ninstallable and can run in the background. Steve to circulate\ndiagrams outline each of the possibilities.</li>\n<li>Steve found an issue when attempting to provide logging through the\nIDS plugin as it interferes with the main IDS logging. Steve\nsuggested changing logging framework  as Log4J interacts badly with\nGlassfish. Tom stated that the new logging framework would be\nrequired to provide daily rolling log files as well as the ability\nto set the maximum size of a log file. Steve is going to test the\nuse of the Java Util logging framework on the ids.storage_file and\nthis will be discussed further at the F2F meeting.</li>\n<li>Agile development to be begin soon for TopCAT v2. Tom mentioned\ninviting the interested parties to the sprint reviews to get\nfeedback on development.</li>\n<li>A new release of the ICAT installer that is compatible with Windows\nwill soon be released by Steve. Sample data will also be offered by\nthe</li>\n</ul>\n<p>installer.</p>\n<h1>Actions</h1>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>ITEM</td>\n<td>DESCRIPTION</td>\n<td>ASSIGNED</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>83.0</td>\n<td>Circulate diagrams to showcase solutions to alternate download protocols for IDS</td>\n<td>Steve</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>83.1</td>\n<td>Invite customer representatives from interested facilities to TopCAT v2 sprint reviews</td>\n<td>Tom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>83.2</td>\n<td>Finalize TopCAT v2 layout mockups and circulate</td>\n<td>Wayne</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>82.0</td>\n<td>LDAP enhancement to work with a functional ID</td>\n<td>Steve</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>82.2</td>\n<td>Alternate download protocols for IDS</td>\n<td>Steve</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>81.0</td>\n<td>Report bug in eclipselink</td>\n<td>Steve</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>81.1</td>\n<td>Circulate response to PaNdata document</td>\n<td>Steve</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>74.0</td>\n<td>Look into JDBC connector resilience with Wildfly</td>\n<td>Steve</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>61.1</td>\n<td>Put the simple ICAT browser into contrib when ready</td>\n<td>Condie</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","frontmatter":{"title":"Meeting 83 – 26 February 2015","date":"2015-02-26T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/collaboration/communication/monthly-meetings/2015-meetings/meeting-83-26-february-2015/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2186722355","3212510956","3248290905","3649515864","4121107168"],"slicesMap":{}}
