The icat.server 4.4.0\nwould have been ready to go out except for the new idea about\nallowing multiple roles which could be added very quickly if people\nagree. It has been discussed today by e-mail. One more snapshot will\nbe produced with this change and in a few days time 4.4.0 will be\nreleased.<br>\nThe next release (4.5.0) will include extra RESTFul calls for the\nbenefit of TopCAT 2 making heavy use of the lucene indexing. Steve\nwould like to drop the existing searchText call if nobody is using\nit. Tom will check with the Mantid people.  These three new calls\nare currently very specialised. Maybe a more generic way can be\nfound in the future but this is not obvious.  The queries use the\nnotion of “my data” which is defined as the existence of an entry in\nthe InvestigationUser table (irrespective of role) to define the\nrelationship between an Investigation and a User. The meeting was\nhappy with this choice. The investigation call is complete and the\ndataset call is almost complete. The datafile code has not yet been\nstarted. It will be tested on a large scale with a clone of the DLS\nICAT. Tom asked if DLS were ingesting via the API which will keep\nthe indices up to date – they are for the bulk of the data but not\nfor the “Investigation”.As the update rules do not work as might be\nexpected Steve plans to check against the UPDATE permissions before\nthe change and against the CREATE permissions after the change.\n This is to make sure that update cannot get the system into a\nstate that could not be achieved by a create call.</li>\n<li>Christophe said that the ICAT manager’s update feature now worked\nproper;y behind a web proxy. He plans a new feature to allow\nmultiple entities to be updated together.</li>\n<li>IDS 1.3 is about ready to release as well. This will be done after\nICAT 4.4.0 has been released though there is no dependency. A couple\nof bugs have been fixed since the last meeting and the mechanism to\nuse a cryptographic hash to protect the datafile location has been\nadded. Rolf told the meeting that he had submitted a bug relating to\na possible race condition.</li>\n<li>Wayne reported on his  latest mock-ups of TopCAT 2. He has received\na number of questions from Rolf which he will address shortly. Wayne\nanswered a question from Tom about the technology to be used and was\ntold that the plan was to to use AngularJS with (probably) jQWidgets\nas it is preferable to use widgets that are free and support\nangular.</li>\n<li>Brian reported that development of the IJP was going smoothly. He\nexplained that when introducing datafile selection it was actually\neasiest to start be selecting available jobs and then you will be\noffered datafiles or datasets according to the type of job.</li>\n<li>Steve was the only person present who had tried Leonardo’s latest\ninstallation scripts. He was a little concerned by the proliferation\nof bash scripts.</li>\n<li>Kevin reported that the Vulcan laser ICAT and ingestion was now in\npre-production and that plans were in hand for another ICAT\ninstallation for Artemis.</li>\n<li>Rolf told us that a new version of python icat was about to be\nreleased once it had been tested with the final release of\nicat.server 4.4.0</li>\n<li>Milan reminded us that a report by PaNData on ICAT experience would\nsoon be made available.</li>\n<li>Andy gave us the good news that the ESS steering committee had\ndecided to use ICAT. They are also going to use ISPyB so we should\nconsider how best to use them together.</li>\n<li>A F2F and Steering Group Meeting for early 2015 was discussed. A\nhost is needed. ESRF are prepared to do this unless someone else\ncomes forward. It was felt that we should not attempt to co-locate\nwith PaNDAas as this would delay things unnecessarily. Steve will\nsend round an e-mail to see if anybody would like to act as host As\nAndy was not sure who was actually on the steering group, Steve will\nset up a mailing list</li>\n<li>Finally Tom told us that this would be his last meeting representing\nISIS as he is starting his new job as group leader in SCD replacing\nBrian Matthews on the 1st</li>\n</ul>\n<p>December.</p>\n<h1>Actions</h1>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>ITEM</th>\n<th>DESCRIPTION</th>\n<th>ASSIGNED</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>80.0</td>\n<td>Find out if Mantid is using the searchText call</td>\n<td>Tom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>80.1</td>\n<td>Seek a host for the 2015 F2F and Steering Group Meeting</td>\n<td>Steve</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>80.2</td>\n<td>Set up mailing list for steering group</td>\n<td>Steve</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>74.0</td>\n<td>Look into JDBC connector resilience with Wildfly</td>\n<td>Steve</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>61.1</td>\n<td>Put the simple ICAT browser into contrib when it is ready</td>\n<td>Condie</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>60.3</td>\n<td>Finalise a release of IJP and send a note to the mailing list</td>\n<td>Brian R</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","frontmatter":{"title":"Meeting 80 – 27 November 2014","date":"2014-11-27T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/collaboration/communication/monthly-meetings/2014-meetings/meeting-80-27-november-2014/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2186722355","3212510956","3248290905","3649515864","4121107168"],"slicesMap":{}}
