One interesting problem has been\nreported by Rolf with a search using limits in conjunction with a\nsearch by id. It would appear that this is not a new problem but is\na bug in eclipselink. If you replace “id=42” with “id IN (42)” it\nworks fine. To fix this would require that the code recognises this\ncase to provide a work-around. Steve proposed that it be marked as a\n“wont fix” but the meeting thought that as ICAT was not working as\nadvertised it should be fixed. No action will be recorded as it is\nalready in the list of issues. Steve will in addition report the\nproblem to eclipse. ICAT 4.5.0 is progressing steadily with\ncustomised lucene searches to match TopCAT2.</li>\n<li>PaNdata have produced a report on ICAT as one of their deliverables.\nThis has been circulated to the steering group. Milan has agreed\nthat it can be made available to all those in the ICAT collaboration\nso Steve will send it round after this meeting. It brings up a\nnumber of interesting issues and exposes some misunderstandings.\nSteve plans to produce a response which will also be sent to the\nicatgroup list.</li>\n<li>Christophe had informed Steve that he has not yet made the planned\nimprovement to his ICAT Manager Steve said that version 1.3 is about\nto be released. Rolf has submitted a bug report – along with a fix\nwhich has not yet been applied. When this has been applied and\ntested another snapshot will be made available before a release is\nmade.</li>\n<li>Following a presentation to DLS on TopCAT2 a number of\nnew requirements were drafted. This document has not yet been\napproved by DLS so will not be circulated yet. Steve went through\nthe points and the following issues were brought up:\n<ol>\n<li>Don’t need filters on column values as well as global filters.</li>\n<li>There was a discussion on scroll bars which get the data when it\ncomes into view as opposed to regular scroll bars where the HTML\nis fully rendered.</li>\n<li>The need for an API to TopCAT was not understood and DLS should\nbe asked to provided Use Cases.</li>\n<li>Nobody other than DLS wanted a Datafile.location view. Steve\nsaid that he thought it would require an extra database table in\nICAT which would be slightly larger than the Datafile table. He\nsuggested making it an ICAT configuration option.</li>\n<li>Matt also said that DLS would like more information on the\nprogress of restores/downloads.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Jan has recently checked some new documentation in.</li>\n<li>Tom reported that the IDS did not seem to recover well from network\nbreaks. Steve will submit a “bug”. Matt asked for the IDS to be able\nto provide usage statistics.</li>\n<li>Brian R reported good progress on the IJP and that he hopes to have\na release around Christmas time making use of the “unixbatch” batch\nserver. T he IJP will now pass datafile Ids to jobs. He has written\nsmall “jobs” to do things such as copying  a datafile to another\ndataset. Interactive jobs are not currently supported as the\nprevious mechanism was too tied to one implementation. This will be\naddressed ASAP.</li>\n<li>Steve asked if there were any changes needed to the schedule of\nmeetings for 2015 – there were none.</li>\n<li>It is expected that the 2015 F2F Meeting and Steering Group Meeting\n will be hosted by DLS. A doodle poll will be carried out once we\nget possible dates from Alun. This should be done before Christmas\nto give people time to obtain travel</li>\n</ul>\n<p>approval.</p>\n<h1>Actions</h1>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>ITEM</th>\n<th>DESCRIPTION</th>\n<th>ASSIGNED</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>81.0</td>\n<td>Report bug in eclipselink</td>\n<td>Steve</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>81.1</td>\n<td>Circulate response to PaNdata document.</td>\n<td>Steve</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>81.2</td>\n<td>Circulate DLS TopCAT 2 requirements</td>\n<td>Steve</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>81.3</td>\n<td>Request use case for TopCAT API</td>\n<td>Steve</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>81.4</td>\n<td>Demo the IJP to the meeting when it has been released.</td>\n<td>Brian R</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>74.0</td>\n<td>Look into JDBC connector resilience with Wildfly</td>\n<td>Steve</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>61.1</td>\n<td>Put the simple ICAT browser into contrib when it is ready</td>\n<td>Condie</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>60.3</td>\n<td>Finalise a release of IJP and send a note to the mailing list</td>\n<td>Brian R</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","frontmatter":{"title":"Meeting 81 – 18 December 2014","date":"2014-12-18T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/collaboration/communication/monthly-meetings/2014-meetings/meeting-81-18-december-2014/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2186722355","3212510956","3248290905","3649515864","4121107168"],"slicesMap":{}}
