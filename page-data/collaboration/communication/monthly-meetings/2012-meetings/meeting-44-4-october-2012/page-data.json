He also reported that there is a deliverable due in\nDecember on the progress of the deployments. Alistair reported that we\nwould visit ILL/ESRF on 18-19/10 and that the first Service Verification\nshould take place around 3 November 2012.</p>\n<p>Ghita reported that there is a meeting scheduled for 11/10/12 about the\nmigration to ICAT 4.3. There is now a test server in DLS running 4.2,\nbut there is no data available.

They are interested in integrating\nTardis with Pandata using Topcat. During 2013, the lead software\nengineer for this work will visit RAL to work on a prototype\nimplementation.</p>\n<p>Nicola reported that work on installing ICAT 4.2.1 was in progress at\nILL and ESRF.</p>\n<p>Shelly reported that she added the following two modules to the icat\nproject contrib repository:</p>\n<p>1. icat-rest-ws is a java based restful web service that retrieves\ncertain metadata with open access such as runs proposals for a given\ninstruments, runs for a given proposal, and file locations of a given\nrun etc.. Tom documented a use case note\nat:<a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/icatproject/wiki/AnonAccessToMetadata\">http://code.google.com/p/icatproject/wiki/AnonAccessToMetadata</a></p>\n<p>2. ingestNexus python script would read a Nexus file, parse metadata,\ncreate ICAT client objects, and calling ICAT server for cataloging. I\nplan to add more comments to the readme file of this module to explain\nwhat it does and how it works.</p>\n<h3>Actions 44</h3>","frontmatter":{"title":"Meeting 44 – 4 October 2012","date":"2012-10-04T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/collaboration/communication/monthly-meetings/2012-meetings/meeting-44-4-october-2012/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2186722355","3212510956","3248290905","3649515864","4121107168"],"slicesMap":{}}
