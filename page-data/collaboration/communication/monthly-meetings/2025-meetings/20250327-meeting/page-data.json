Interesting discussions but not directly ICAT related. Otherwise nothing else to report.</p>\n<h3>ESRF</h3>\n<p>Nothing new, progressing on technques. Working on including more processed data in the data portal.</p>\n<p>Working on OSCARS project on sample metadata in coming weeks and months. Discussion with Rolf next week on this topic.</p>\n<h3>ISIS</h3>\n<p>Payara server upgrade to 6. Currently on staging. Out to production within the week hopefully.</p>\n<h3>DLS</h3>\n<p>Had DataGateway &#x26; ICAT server &#x26; lucene upgrade released. Working on visit restore release now</p>\n<h2>Component Updates</h2>\n<h3>datagateway-download-api</h3>\n<p>Single visit restore via queueing functionality.</p>\n<p>Rolf: IDS can sometimes perform badly when multiple restores at the same time. Add a parameter to limit the number of restores.\nLouise: there's some extra visit splitting functionality as well as DLS visits are very large</p>\n<h3>ICAT 7 schema changes</h3>\n<p>Rolf says he may have a student who can work on icat.server issues.</p>\n<p>Rolf: STFC asked about Instrument startDate &#x26; endDate additions? Would be good if you could create a formal issue\nLouise: sure</p>\n<h2>AOB</h2>\n<h3>icat.schema</h3>\n<p>Investigation -> Dataset -> Datafile.</p>\n<p>More longer term experiments e.g. catalysis experiments, multiple hours. Lots of beamline measurements to observe sample changes. Want whole thing to be a Dataset, but might want to search for individual beamline measurements.</p>\n<p>Proposal: Datasets within Datasets?\nWould have a lot of consequences</p>\n<p>Louise: STFC facilities either only have 1 dataset (ISIS) or have datasets generally respresenting wrong things anyway (DLS - directories as datasets)</p>\n<p>Alex: single dataset, up to user to filter measurements within the dataset. Ideally keep ICAT as simple as possible</p>\n<p>Rolf: XAS measurement search, you might want to search an individual experiment as a measurement could be repeated many times within</p>\n<p>Louise: complex, could have infinite nesting of datasets!</p>\n<p>Rolf: maybe not, you have control of your ingestion pipeline</p>\n<p>Alex: we have the opposite, we have many datasets that we want to group as one. Search is more of a problem but we think it's fine to e.g. search by technique etc. and rely on user to search files for specific measurements</p>\n<p>Louise: we probably need time to think about this offline</p>\n<p>Rolf: can discuss at next F2F?</p>\n<h3>Next F2F?</h3>\n<p>Louise: we'll have to discuss with with our GL</p>\n<p>Kevin: yes, will need to think of when/who will host</p>\n<p>Kevin: sometimes we tag these on to other events - does anyone have ideas for this?</p>\n<p>Louise: how about we think about this offline with our institutions and discuss more concretely next time? maybe send out polls after that</p>\n<p>Rolf: can't attend the next 2 collab meetings</p>\n<h3>Next meeting</h3>\n<p>24th April - week of Easter Monday</p>\n<p>Rolf: exactly why I can't go!</p>\n<p>Louise: well April is always hard, in between week before/after Easter &#x26; school holidays which may/may not overlap struggle to get everyone to attend anyway</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"ICAT Collaboration Meeting - 27th March 2025","date":"2025-03-27T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/collaboration/communication/monthly-meetings/2025-meetings/20250327-meeting/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2186722355","3212510956","3248290905","3649515864","4121107168"],"slicesMap":{}}
