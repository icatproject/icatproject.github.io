In next couple of months, want the work for indexing in Opensearch deployed. Also move ICAT sever to Quarkus (effictively alterntive to Payara so less admin overhead). May not be do-able in time. For pre-prod will use Docker compose. Only server and authn. Rest is separate components.</p>\n<p>What about the ingestion? You have nothing...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ingestion is separate and would be handled by the Facility.</li>\n<li>Would need to be synchronised. Want a generic way to ingest the Dataset. They are linked to proposals. For our Facilities it is similar.</li>\n<li>Generic would be good. But for STFC it's the one thing we can hand off so probably not going to develop it ourselves.</li>\n<li>Isnt Python ICAT genreic? Yes.</li>\n<li>Define XML schema (xlsd) - defines what's allowed in your XML</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alex:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>message broker/ActiveMQ - do stuff like DOI minting, processed data etc. more jobs than just ingestion</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sirius - are you going to develop your own ingestor?\nAllan:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Under discussion, working on getting data from API onto ICAT, bluesky</li>\n<li>Discussion for generic API for ingestion, e.g. user portal</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Andy: want ActiveMQ not bluesky\nAllan: using Kafka, need to look at pros/cons</p>\n<p>Alex: we want a black box, need to be useful for all facilities. Don't care about the specific technology as long as it works...\nAllan: sounds good</p>\n<h3>DLS</h3>\n<p>Last month, users reported some performance problems browsing datafiles/datasets. Worked on a workaround fix for slow queries. Basic problem is size of DLS ICAT, authorisation slows things down.\nAlex: what is slow? 10s, 1 minute?\nKevin: We time out after a minute, but problem is DB still processing whilst user sends more queries\nProblem is the Rules, Alan thinking about ideas to improve. for now workaround in datagateway-api - we check if user can see parent entity, and then uses a read all account to do the actual query\nAlex: only Datafiles problem?\nKevin: also having problems at Datasets level, which is maybe 50 million. May just be caused by slow Datafile queries causing DB slowness.\nPut the fix in place on Tuesday, and queries have stopped timing out</p>\n<p>Kevin: Alex you were asking about DB sizes, haven't had a chance to put our stats in but we're interested in the research\nAlex: yes, our DB admins were concerned about CPU load. Only rare, but we're logging all queries performance in ICAT+ so we can monitor</p>\n<p>Alan: long-term, take searches off of the DB and onto ElasticSearch instead.\nPatrick: challenge is Rules are dynamically evaluated, e.g. removing an investigationUser revokes their access immediately.</p>\n<p>Andy: time series, after a set amount of time assert data is static and move it to another, non-modifiable place.\nAlan: Sharded index could work for that\nPatrick: old data can have static rules e.g.</p>\n<p>Patrick: hard to have a truly generic solution</p>\n<h3>Sirius</h3>\n<p>ICAT ready for production, IT going to run some tests. In about a month ICAT may be able to be open to community</p>\n<p>Minor issue of displaying HDF files in DataPortal. May reach out to ESRF for help if necessary. Trying to understand h5view &#x26; h5grove - studying the documentation.\nAndy: ESRF can meet you on Zoom</p>\n<h2>Component Updates</h2>\n<h3>icat.server</h3>\n<p>Has put a message out to icat mailing list, new versions of ICAT 5 and ICAT 6. If you create a Rule via entitymanager endpoint, the new Rule is used to authorise the user instead of using only old Rules. Basically meant any user can make a Rule giving them full access, then they have full access.</p>\n<p>Failure of the logic, Alan has now separated the logic into separate transactions.</p>\n<h2>AOB</h2>","frontmatter":{"title":"ICAT Collaboration Meeting - 3rd October 2024","date":"2024-10-03T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/collaboration/communication/monthly-meetings/2024-meetings/20241003-meeting/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2186722355","3212510956","3248290905","3649515864","4121107168"],"slicesMap":{}}
