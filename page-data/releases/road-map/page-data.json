It tries to look one year ahead and will be updated as\nnecessary.</p>\n<h2>General</h2>\n<h4>Container Compatibility</h4>\n<p><em>December 2016</em></p>\n<p>Ensure that all components work on Glassfish 4.1 and current Wildfly as\nwell as the old Glassfish 4.0 that we are currently using.<br>\nIf security updates were abandoned on Glassfish 4.0 we would currently\nhave a problem.</p>\n<h4>Plan migration to Angular 2</h4>\n<p><em>December 2016</em></p>\n<p>Angular 1 will lose support at some point. We need a plan to migrate\ncomponents with some timescale.</p>\n<h4>Plan improvements to the icatproject.org website</h4>\n<p><em>June 2017</em></p>\n<p>Depending upon the results from the reviewers the web site development\nmay be evolutionary or revolutionary.</p>\n<h2>ICAT Server</h2>\n<p><em>Dec 2016 (probably 4.9.0)</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support multiple load-balanced ICAT servers</li>\n<li>Provide SOAP interface to authenticator information</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>June 2017 (probably 5.0.0)</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consider design of a new major version with schema changes to give:\n<ul>\n<li>a more file system like view of the data which should also\naddress the problem that different tree structures are overlayed\non the schema graph</li>\n<li>better handling of data collections</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>OAI-PMH Interface</h2>\n<p><em>June 2017 (probably 1.0.0)</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This will be a service which offers OAI-PMH metadata which it will\nget from an icat.server. <em>There is some code in contrib which might\nhelp.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>IDS</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Simplify the locking</li>\n<li>Implement option of late writing -- i.e. normal cache behaviour</li>\n<li>Think again about multiple IDS servers. The new locking mechanism\nmight benefit this.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Pollcat</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Formalise the release process.</li>\n<li>Provide an example plugin.</li>\n<li>Provide guidance on how and when to use.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>smartclient</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Beautify the GUI</li>\n<li>Consider moving a group of small files together. <em>Note that this\ndoes complicate the current very simple design so will only be done\nif there are real performance benefits.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>idav</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Make idav more configurable so that it can be easily deployed by\nfacilities with different ICAT hierarchies</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>TopCAT</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide the ability to upload datafiles</li>\n<li>Fix bugs and provide enhancements as more people use it</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>IJP plugin for TopCAT</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve batch system brokering</li>\n<li>Support job types with specific batch requirements (e.g. GPU\nsupport)</li>\n<li>Support versioning of datasets (as an application of custom search\nresults filtering) <em>This is needed by Octopus but may be developed\ninto something of more general applicability.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>DOI plugin for TopCAT</h2>\n<p><em>March 2017</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is currently too tailored to one facility. It will be\nrefactored and probably a new service introduced so that other\nfacilities can use the mechanism.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Dashboard</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve reliability and testability with better error handling and\nby writing more unit tests.</li>\n<li>Improve compatibility with different hierarchies.</li>\n<li>Add more functionality that will be useful to the facilities by\nopening it up to the ICAT group for ideas.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Python-icat</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve documentation.</li>\n<li>Keep compatibility with upcoming ICAT and IDS versions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>ICATManager</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix existing bugs</li>\n<li>Improve look and feel</li>\n<li>Add ability to execute a JPQL query</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Road Map","date":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/releases/road-map/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2186722355","3212510956","3248290905","3649515864","4121107168"],"slicesMap":{}}
