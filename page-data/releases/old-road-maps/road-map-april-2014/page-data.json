It tries to look one year ahead and will be updated\nquarterly. For each component the order gives an impression of the\nrelative priority.</p>\n<p>There are currently no plans to make any changes to the ICAT schema nor\nAPI nor to change or remove the speculative features. There are also no\nplanned changes to icat-setup. ICE (ICAT Editor) is being used currently\nto prototype a GWT replacement -- if it looks suitable it may be kept to\nprovide a product with a more modern looking interface.</p>\n<h2>ICAT Server</h2>\n<p>September 2014</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the provision of a JSON based RESTful web service -- this should\ninclude the ability to migrate metadata/data between ICAT/IDS\ninstances. This will allow a file to be prepared of data to be fed\ninto ICAT. Functionality of the old XMLIngest will be included. The\nnew mechanism will be more general as it will be able to deal with\nany ICAT data and not just a hierarchical projection of that data.\nIt will also allow a new ICAT to be configured very rapidly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>January 2015</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the use of a non-relational database to give better performance at\nlarge scale. Some kind of hybrid between relational and\nnon-relational might be optimal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>IDS</h2>\n<p>May 2014</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Change the plugin interface to provide more information to the\nplugin (e.g. Dataset.location)</li>\n<li>Add an extra call which the plugin must implement to compute the\nfull file name of a zip file entry.\n<ul>\n<li>Could provide the existing algorithm as a default</li>\n<li>Facility may choose to base the zip file entry on its own\nstorage structure to trivially guarantees unique names</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The IDS computes checksums where data files are uploaded so can use\nthis information to provide background checking that all data can be\ncorrectly read to provide the expected checksum</li>\n</ul>\n<p>August 2014</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add the ability to work well when deployed on a shared file system</li>\n<li>Extend to provide FUSE file system authorized by ICAT</li>\n</ul>\n<h2> TopCAT</h2>\n<p>May 2014</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Datafile upload via the IDS</li>\n</ul>\n<p>July 2014</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Include adding, updating and deleting dataset and datafile\nparameters</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Oct 2014</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhanced support for multiple facilities</li>\n<li>Reduce code dependencies</li>\n<li>Avoid facility dependent code</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Jan 2015</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Replace GWT</li>\n<li>Possibly include graphic displays</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>IJP</h2>\n<p>June 2014</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To make IJP available to others  will provide a very simple demo\nconfiguration with jobs such as concatenating copying and deleting\ndatafiles.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sep 2014</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Currently only works on a single platform . Users want it to run on\nat least three very different platforms (different OS, different\nbatch system etc.) -- but to present a single GUI. This requires (at\nleast):\n<ul>\n<li>abstracting the batch system</li>\n<li>providing a very simple \"meta-scheduler\"</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Road Map – April 2014","date":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/releases/old-road-maps/road-map-april-2014/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2186722355","3212510956","3248290905","3649515864","4121107168"],"slicesMap":{}}
