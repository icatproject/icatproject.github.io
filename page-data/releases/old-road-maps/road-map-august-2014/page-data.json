It tries to look one year ahead and will be updated three\ntimes a year.</p>\n<p>There are currently no plans to make any changes to the ICAT schema nor\nAPI nor to change or remove the speculative features.</p>\n<h2>ICAT Server</h2>\n<p>October 2014</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide a JSON based RESTful web service  to migrate metadata/data\nbetween ICAT/IDS instances. This will allow a file to be prepared of\ndata to be fed into ICAT. Functionality of the old XMLIngest will be\nincluded. The new mechanism will be more general as it will be able\nto deal with any ICAT data and not just a hierarchical projection of\nthat data. It will also allow a new ICAT to be configured very\nrapidly.</li>\n<li>Fix the \"DISTINCT\" bug which affects aggregate functions</li>\n<li>Allow authz rules to support projections</li>\n<li>Configurable limit on the total number of objects returned by a\nquery -- exception if exceeded.</li>\n<li>Include the InvestigationGroup and explain how it should be used.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>March 2015</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete RESTful interface to parallel the SOAP one</li>\n<li>Provide client object generation for Java and Python</li>\n<li>Support Wildfly</li>\n</ul>\n<p>May 2015</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Investigate the use of a non-relational database to give better\nperformance at large scale. Some kind of hybrid between relational\nand non-relational might be optimal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>IDS</h2>\n<p>October 2014</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide FUSE file system authorized by ICAT</li>\n</ul>\n<p>December 2014</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support option for secondary level storage to be by datafile (as\nwell as data set as at present).</li>\n<li>Ensure that multiple IDS deployments can share the same archive\nstorage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2> TopCAT</h2>\n<p>September 2014</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Include adding, updating and deleting dataset and datafile\nparameters</li>\n</ul>\n<p>September 2014</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Agreement on new look.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Jan 2015</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implementation of new look based on bootstrap and AngularJS and the\nelimination of GWT</li>\n<li>Simple multi-facility searching</li>\n<li>Tabbed facilities</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>IJP</h2>\n<p>October 2014</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Refactor IJP to separate out the batch work which is very platform\ndependent.</li>\n<li>Provide an easy to deploy IJP with one batch system (basic Unix\nbatch).
