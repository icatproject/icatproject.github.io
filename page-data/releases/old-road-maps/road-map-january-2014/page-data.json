It tries to look one year ahead and will be updated\nquarterly. For each component the order gives an impression of the\nrelative priority.</p>\n<h2>ICAT Core</h2>\n<p>There are currently no plans to make any changes to the schema or API\nnor to change or remove the speculative features. There are also no\nplanned changes to icat-setup. ICE (ICAT Editor) is being used currently\nto prototype a GWT replacement -- if it looks suitable it may be kept to\nprovide a product with a more modern looking interface. A number of\nareas, some of which may be dead ends, will be investigated including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>clustered deployment (single lucene index etc.) to provide better\nperformance and to allow a machine to be dedicated to ingestion</li>\n<li>improved API documentation -- in particular how to do queries and a\nfuller explanation of the authorization and how to write rules that\nare efficient.</li>\n<li>the provision of a JSON based RESTful web service -- this should be\na rather easy add-on</li>\n<li>ability to migrate metadata/data between ICAT/IDS instances. This\nwill allow a file to be prepared of data to be fed into ICAT.\nFunctionality of the old XMLIngest will be included. The new\nmechanism will be more general as it will be able to deal with any\nICAT data and not just a hierarchical projection of that data. It\nwill also allow a new ICAT to be configured very rapidly.</li>\n<li>the use of a non-relational database to give better performance at\nlarge scale. Some kind of hybrid between relational and\nnon-relational might be optimal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2> TopCAT</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide data file upload facilities via the IDS</li>\n<li>Rationalize and simplify the code and reduce dependencies -- this\nwill result in more maintainable software. If plugins are needed\nthey should not be compiled into the distribution.</li>\n<li>It would be desirable to separate off code for doing the\nconfederation, possibly into a small independent service.</li>\n<li>Add visualisation features (simple analysis of one and two\ndimensional data) by packaging such functionality already developed\nby the ICAT team at STFC for one of their facilities code</li>\n<li>Find a replacement for GWT which is now rather old and with a\nshrinking community and produce a more modern interface</li>\n<li>ICE might be included in TopCAT</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>IDS</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The IDS computes checksums where data files are uploaded so can use\nthis information to provide background checking that all data can be\ncorrectly read to provide the expected checksum</li>\n<li>Add the ability to work well when deployed on a shared file system</li>\n<li>Extend to provide FUSE file system authorized by ICAT</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>IJP</h2>\n<p>This is the most immature member of the ICAT family -- but probably with\nthe most potential for further development. It allows submission of jobs\nwhere data selection is based on ICAT information and the data are\nhandled by IDS.  Both batch and interactive jobs are supported.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>many small changes to meet evolving requirements</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Road Map – January 2014","date":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/releases/old-road-maps/road-map-january-2014/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2186722355","3212510956","3248290905","3649515864","4121107168"],"slicesMap":{}}
